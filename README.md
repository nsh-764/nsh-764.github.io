#### Work @ [ATLAN](https://atlan.com/)
Data Science Associate (Nov 2018 - Jan 2020)

It's a startup from New Delhi focusing on building insight-packs using alternative/external data (spatial and non-spatial) to provide actionable insights across sectors and industries. I was an integral part of the data team that helped bring a lot of these spatial and non-spatial data sources into data workflow pipelines to help build interesting and useful insight-packs. I particularly handled spatial data that involved data acquisition, cleaning and preparing the datasets for the models (products) to be built upon. Some of the insight-packs include affluence index of towns (metro & non-metro), economic growth index for rural areas, population demography by age, gender for urban and rural areas.

What are insight-packs? [Case studies](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw2onH2foCdMTjMzMXdGM2loN19TNTFFNFJDbGtMZUdvQnJv)

I particularly handled a few key spatial datasets that were integral inputs into these insight-packs. I built an entire ETL pipeline for Nightlights from the source to clean raster outputs that scaled to entire India. Building nightlights, creating a methodology to identify the urban sprawl expansion using nightlights, assessing the nightlight lit roads as one of the proxies to understand safety and crime in disconnected urban areas, also a methodology for identifying the origins/core urban pockets in cities are few of the major tasks that were based on VIIRS nighttime lights satellite imagery.

I also worked on getting the high-rise-buildings footprint, their height, the approximate number of households in each building for understanding the urban sprawl and affluence in the metro regions of India. This was a major input for creating the building level affluence index insight-pack for metro cities. Few other projects I handled include, the prediction of rural population at village level for all 6+ lakh villages of India for 2019, identifying the roads using satellite and basemaps together (their area, length, orientation order, number of intersection and end nodes at 0.1 sq km hex grids level) as an input for affluence index for smaller towns.

* Insight-packs that I handled or was part of. See the [catalogue](https://grid.atlan.com/search/Global) 

    (Examples: Demography - population count for villages in 2019, [High Rise Buildings](https://grid.atlan.com/insights/high-rise-buildings/), Nightlights, [Lit Roads](https://grid.atlan.com/insights/lit-roads/), Demography - Age gender profile, Railway Insights, Road Network, [Rural Sentiment Index](https://grid.atlan.com/insights/rural-sentiment-index/), [Temperature](https://grid.atlan.com/insights/temperature-insights/) and [Rainfall](https://grid.atlan.com/insights/rainfall-insights/) Insights)

* I also built an internal cloud data access tool called [cloudDS](https://samashti.github.io/works/cloud_m.html) that was built on Apache Libcloud and awscli.

#### Other personal projects

* [GeoPackagePy](https://github.com/samashti/GeoPackage-py) - a python wrapper module built on top of pandas and geopandas to handle geopackge vector files at more basic level using sql-queries. (To be added soon - spatial views, handle both spatial and non-spatial layers in a geopackage and maintain a file-meta)

* [ns3](https://github.com/samashti/ns3) - Nested S3 - Display the objects on S3 bucket path in a tree-like diagram, It uses the tree command to display the objects in an s3 bucketpath in a tree-like diagram.

* [JenksGTiff](https://github.com/samashti/JenksGTiff) - Apply Jenks Natural Breaks on Geotiff files and get output image with graduated symbology.

* [stitchImages](https://github.com/samashti/stitchImages) - Stitch two images by identifying common features at the common boundary.

* [PolyExtract](https://github.com/samashti/PolyExtract) - Extract Polygons from an image that contain shapes such as agriculture fields and find their area.
