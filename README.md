### Work @ [FluroSat](https://flurosat.com/)

Geospatial Data Programmer (Consultant Contract) (Jun 2018 - Oct 2018)

After a 10-month long research experience in astronomy and astrophysics project at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research - Tirupati, I joined a startup from Australia called FluroSat as a remote consultant for GIS/python/Computer vision developer role.

- I worked on building several GIS software tools for the agri-tech startup using Python, GDAL, QGIS, Image Processing etc.

- It included works on hyperspectral satellite image analysis to derive vegetation indices from Sentinel 2, soil analysis, detecting tree canopies and the number of plants in a plantation

- and, a POC work on monitoring the health of the agricultural produce using satellite and IoT devices simultaneously.

### Work @ [Atlan](https://atlan.com/)

Data Science Associate (Nov 2018 - Jan 2020)

It's a startup from New Delhi focusing on building insight packs using alternative data (spatial and non-spatial) to provide actionable insights across sectors and industries.

What are insight-packs? [Case studies](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw2onH2foCdMTjMzMXdGM2loN19TNTFFNFJDbGtMZUdvQnJv)

I was an integral part of the data team that helped bring these spatial and non-spatial data sources into data workflow pipelines to help build insight packs. I handled a few key spatial datasets to build the insight-packs. I built an entire ETL pipeline for several the data insight-packs from the source to clean raster outputs scaled to pan India.

- Nightlights Insight Pack (VIIRS Satellite Imagery)

- Rural Sentiment Index

- Creating a methodology to identify the urban sprawl expansion using nightlights

- High-Rise Buildings

- Understanding a city's infra, growth and expansion through the network of roads and their orientation order.

- Assessing the nightlight lit roads as one of the proxies to understand safety and crime in disconnected urban areas

- Devising a methodology for identifying the origins/core urban pockets in cities

- Prediction of rural population at village level for all 6+ lakh villages of India for 2019

Some of the other insight-packs that I helped build in the team include;

- Affluence Index (at City and Building level)

- Economic Growth Index at Rural area

- Population demography by Age, Gender for rural and urban at hex8 grid level

I also helped several of our clients from FMCG, CBFC, and Startups with various spatial analytics projects with their decision making process and help them increase their revenue through the geospatial insights from our products and analysis.

How are insight-packs built? [Affluence index at building level](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw2onH2foCdMN2duMkQxY3Utc2xmU0J4Q0JOaEllQjFmTk1R)

- I also built an internal cloud data access tool called _[cloudDS]_(https://samashti.github.io/works/cloud_m.html) that was built on Apache Libcloud and awscli.

**NOTE**: Some links from Atlan might be no longer active as the company switched from DS to product based service.

### Work @ [Quilt.AI](https://quilt.ai/)

Data Scientist (Mar 2020 - Jun 2021)

At Quilt AI, I led a project build a [climate change vulnerability dashboard](https://www.quilt.ai/post/putting-climate-and-data-into-action) for more than 3000 cities around the world that focused on understanding the climate variability, socio-economic risks and the search behavior patterns. Using these, I was able to devise a way to classify audiences into different segments from Avoidant to Activist extremities to help decision makers to strategise their climate action campaign in these cities. This project helped several governments and NGOs in their climate change campaign.

Other projects that I have handled at Quilt AI are;

- A Vaccination Campaign Analysis in the states of UP and Bihar for a client

- A Campaign analysis for creating awareness on adolescent girls' menstrual health for an NGO

- Twitter Audience Insights and Spatial analysis of tweets to use for awareness and ad campaigns

- I also helped generate more than 180 maps with dashboard capabilities within a span of 30 days as part of our awareness campaign through blogs.

### Work @ [PwC](https://quilt.ai/)

Senior Associate - Data Science (Jul 2021 - Present)

At PwC, I have worked on several geospatial analysis and python automation projects. My projects include;

- A geospatial analysis project to help a client that provide steam pipelines to households expand their business in the neighborhood

- Credit default risk prediction project using ML and geospatial analysis to predict defaulters that leveraged both spatial and non-spatial data sources.

- An automation project to help our internal Financial Markets team in their audit tasks and processes by automating manual tie-outs and reducing almost 300 hours of manual hours for each person in a year.

- In another automation project, I helped build an automation to help our FM team to generate audit reports and manual formulations on MS Excel to reduce on an average 600 hours of manula hours for each person in a year.

### Other personal projects

- [GeoPackagePy](https://github.com/samashti/GeoPackage-py) - a python wrapper module built on top of pandas and geopandas to handle geopackge vector files at more basic level using sql-queries. (To be added soon - spatial views, handle both spatial and non-spatial layers in a geopackage and maintain a file-meta)

- [ns3](https://github.com/samashti/ns3) - Nested S3 - Display the objects on S3 bucket path in a tree-like diagram, It uses the tree command to display the objects in an s3 bucketpath in a tree-like diagram.

- [JenksGTiff](https://github.com/samashti/JenksGTiff) - Apply Jenks Natural Breaks on Geotiff files and get output image with graduated symbology.

- [stitchImages](https://github.com/samashti/stitchImages) - Stitch two images by identifying common features at the common boundary.

- [PolyExtract](https://github.com/samashti/PolyExtract) - Extract Polygons from an image that contain shapes such as agriculture fields and find their area.
